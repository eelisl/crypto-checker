# Crypto Checker

## Challenge

Instructions: https://vincit.fi/risingstar/Vincit-Rising-Star-2021-Pre-assignment.pdf

Instructions also included in the root of this project if the support for the pdf ends on their end.

## Goals

- Practice making fullstack apps
- Widen the portfolio

## What the APP does

Input two dates and get info about Bitcoin! Longest consecutive Bear Market days, maximum trading volume and a real life time machine (sort of)!

## How to use

- Visit cryptochecker.eelisloikkanen.fi for deployed app
- deploy yourself, check "How to deploy locally"

## Github-repo

This app resides in github.com/b4thinking

## How to deploy locally

- Install node.js (LTS) and latest npm 
- Clone FrontEnd and API repos
- In terminal, at FrontEnd folder, first run "node install", then "npm start"
- In second terminal, at API folder, run "node index.js"

## What to improve

This is only a short challenge for a job application, so I will not be coming back to this challenge. However, it is good to be aware how to make the app better:

- App could be fledged out more, CoinGecko offers lots of API offers
- Front end could be better:
    - input for the dates has little improvements
    - Contact page could be improved
    - Colors and images could be revamped
